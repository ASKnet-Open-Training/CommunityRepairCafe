How to start up a repair cafe?
Few Tips for starting a Repair Cafe
1.Visit a couple of established Repair Cafes

Don’t get hung up on health and safety and insurance.
> Make sure repairers work within the limits of their skills and, 
if necessary, get help from other repairers.
> Explain to owners that you are enthusiastic amateurs not paid 
professionals (also use a disclaimer
> Don’t take on a major repair if you’re not happy to do so for 
any reason. We always say we’re a clinic not a hospital.

Get advance bookings

4.Try to make sure your venue allows you to have repairs and 
waiting area in the same space. This means waiting owners can see 
what’s going on – that there’s a queue – and don’t feel they are 
being ignored.

Encourage repairers to give a running commentary Owners are expected 
to stay with their items and the repairers while s/he assesses the 
problem and talks through any repairs undertaken.
The idea is that the owner leaves knowing more about his/her item than 
when they arrived. Some Repair Cafes offer ‘skillshare’ sessions to teach 
DIY repair work.

Encourage repairers to be honest about their abilities.

Get owners to sign a ‘disclaimer’ when they arrive. A Repair Cafe should 
have a set of ‘rules’ that clarifies the relationship between owner and 
repairer. Ask the owners to read and sign it – it will not stand up in court
but helps establish the amateur nature of our (voluntary) work.

Do some market research. You can test out the best times and days for running 
your events.

Get feedback We ask attenders to filling in a short series of questions when 
they leave and also record the success (or otherwise) of assessment and repair. 
This is useful for publicity, for reporting back to repairers, and useful if 
you ever need to make a grant application for running costs.

Invite donations We alert people in advance to the fact that the event is free, but we appreciate donations to cover insurance, venue hire, refreshments, consumables such as glues and fuses, publicity materials etc
