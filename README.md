### REPAIR IS BETTER THAN RECYCLING
Making our things last longer is both more efficient and more
cost-effective than mining them for raw materials.

### REPAIR SAVES YOU MONEY
Fixing things is often free, and usually cheaper than replacing
them. Doing the repair yourself saves you money.

### REPAIR TEACHES ENGINEERING
The best way to find put how something works is to take it apart.

### REPAIR SAVES THE PLANET
Earth has limited resources. Eventually we will run our.
The best way to be efficient is to reuse what we already have.
